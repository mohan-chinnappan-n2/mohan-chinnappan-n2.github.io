## Relation Join Types


 - Inner join
    - You can use an inner join in a SELECT statement to retrieve only the rows that satisfy the join conditions on every specified table.
 - Left outer join
    - The LEFT OUTER JOIN clause lists rows from the left table even if there are no matching rows on right table.
- Right outer join
    - The RIGHT OUTER JOIN clause lists rows from the right table even if there are no matching rows on left table.
- Full outer join
    - The FULL OUTER JOIN clause results in the inclusion of rows from two tables. If a value is missing when rows are joined, that value is null in the result table.
