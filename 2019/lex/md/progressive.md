## Progressive Rendering (Communities)
- Progressive Rendering prioritizes the display order of your page components. With proper planning and testing, it can improve display time performance and polish your communityâ€™s experience to better engage customers.

- Progressive Rendering improves the performance of your page by fetching and rendering page components in a **parallel and prioritized manner**. 
- If you notice that your community pages take a long time to load before you see the components rendered on the screen, then progressive rendering may help improve your experience.


### Levels

 - Highest	
    - Highest priority components are displayed first. This priority is recommended for key content that you want to display first or content that appears above the fold on longer pages.
 - High	
    - High priority components are displayed after all components in the Highest group.
 - Neutral	
    - Neutral priority components are displayed after all other components that have a higher priority. By default, all components begin with a Neutral priority.
