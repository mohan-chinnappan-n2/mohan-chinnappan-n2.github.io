##  Experienced Page Time (EPT)

- With Winter â€˜19, we have exposed Experienced Page Time (EPT) to everyone on the Salesforce Platform. This EPT metric, better understood as Page Load time, can be explored through the Lightning Usage App which highlights the performance at both a browser and page level.
