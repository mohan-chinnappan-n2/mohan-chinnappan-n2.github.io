## Data Lake

### What is Data Lake?
 - A data storage strategy
- Pool of unstructured semi-structured and structured data, stored as-is over extended periods of time, without a specific purpose in mind.
- Allows multiple points of collection and multiple points of access (batch, interactive, online, search, in-memory,... ) for large volumes of data.
- Allows collection of data for future needs before it’s possible to know what those needs are, 
- Data stored is raw, Data Lake shouldn’t be accessed directly 
 
### Comparing with Data Mart  ( Quoting: James Dixon - who coined the term 'Data Lake')
 -  If you think of a Data Mart as a store of bottled water – cleansed and packaged and structured for easy consumption 
 -  Data Lake is a large body of water in a more natural state. 
    - The contents of the Data Lake stream in from a source to fill the lake, and various users of the lake can come to examine, dive in, or take samples.” 
 - The cost of storing data is relatively low as compared to the Data Warehouse
