### Spotify

#### Key points

 - Continuous improvement:  Look for ways to continuously improve, both personally, and in the wider organization.
 - Iterative development:  Believe in short learning cycles, so that we can validate our assumptions as quickly as possible.
 - Simplicity:     Simplicity should be your guidance during scaling. This is as true for our technical solutions, as for our methods of working and organizing the organization.
 - Trust: Trust our people and teams to make informed decisions about the way they work and what they work on.
 - Servant leadership: Managers are focused on coaching, mentorship, and solving impediments rather than telling people what to do.
