- Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
- Imagination is more important than knowledge.
- If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.
- Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.
- Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving.
- No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it.
- The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.
- I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious.
- Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.
- Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.
- Stay away from negative people, they have problem for every solution.
