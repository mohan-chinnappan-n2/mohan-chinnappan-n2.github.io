## Water Resource Management

- Proper Water Resource Management is the key
- Water stored under the soil is only for the plants
    - Entities living above the soil including human, birds, animals,.. should not have access to the under-the-soil water
    - Obtaining water from drilling the land will reduce the water level to level where plants can't reach and result in death of those plants
- Stop importing [petroleum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum) oil 
    - Produce [Ethanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol) from [Corn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_ethanol) and [Sugarcane](https://sugarcane.org/ethanol/)
    - Use [E85](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E85) as the prime fuel
