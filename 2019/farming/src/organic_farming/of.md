# Organic Farming


- Organic Farming relies on fertilizers of organic origin such as **compost manure, green manure, and bone meal** and places emphasis on techniques such as crop rotation and companion planting.

- Biological pest control, mixed cropping and the fostering of insect predators are encouraged. 

- Organic standards are designed to allow the use of naturally occurring substances while prohibiting or strictly limiting synthetic substances.
