## Salesforce Optimizer Report

- Salesforce generates a PDF report with recommendations to improve your implementation and saves the report to Salesforce Files.
- Salesforce also saves a .xls file in Salesforce Files. The file includes some of the information from the report:
    - Feature section and subsection per the reportâ€™s table of contents
    - Type of feature analyzed, along with the number of items found
    - Severity of observation

### Trending and triggers
- Use the .xls file to **load the data into Salesforce to analyze it for trending and historical analysis**. 
- By uploading data into a Salesforce custom object, you can create workflow triggers and alerts when various thresholds are reached.
