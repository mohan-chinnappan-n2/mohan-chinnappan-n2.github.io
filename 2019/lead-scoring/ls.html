        <h3>Lead Scoring</h3>
        <p>
          Lead scoring is a methodology for ranking leads in order to determine their <b>sales-readiness</b>.
          We score leads based on lead's :
          <ul>
            <li><b>interest</b> in our business</li>
            <li><b>current place</b> in the buying cycle</li>
            <li><b>fit</b> in regards to our business</li>
          </ul>

          Lead scoring helps companies know whether <b>prospects</b> need to be:
          <ul>
            <li> fast-tracked to sales </li>
            <li>developed with lead nurturing</li>
          </ul>

          Factors making up the Lead Score:

          <p><b>Firmographics attributes</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>company size</li>
            <li>technologies used</li>
            <li>industry</li>
            <li>geographic area</li>
            <li>job title</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Behavioral attributes</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>clicks on the website</li>
            <li>page views</li>
            <li>article downloads</li>
            <li>time spend on the website</li>
            <li>did they click on the email we sent</li>
            <li>participated in web chat</l i>
          </ul>

        <h3>Lead Scoring Examples</h3>
        Lead Scoring goal is clarity of a sales-ready lead by assigning points/terms like
        <ul>
          <li> A, B, C, D</li>
          <li>‘hot’, ‘warm’ or ‘cold’</li>

          Einstein Lead Scoring, a key capability of Sales Cloud
          Einstein, helps sales reps convert more leads, faster.
          <br>

          Uses artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically analyze
          your <b>historical sales data</b> and discover the top factors
          that determine whether a <b>lead is likely to convert</b> to
          an opportunity.

          <br>
          Sales reps can segment and prioritize leads, and gain insight
          into the factors that explain why leads are likely to convert or
          not.
        </p>

        <p><b>How it works?</b>
          <br>

          Einstein looks at your company’s past leads, including any custom fields,
          to find patterns in your successful lead conversion history. <br>

          Einstein Lead Scoring then determines which of your current leads fit your success patterns best.
          <br>
          Each lead receives a score indicating how well it fits your patterns,
          along with insights about which of the lead’s fields affect its score most.

        <h3>Einstein Lead Scoring Setup</h3>

        <p>Key inputs need for the setting up


          <ul>
            <li>Which conversion milestone constitutes success for your company?<br>

              Tell Einstein whether you convert leads simply to <b>accounts and contacts</b>,
              or also to <b>opportunities, contact, and account</b>.

              Should Einstein consider <b>all lead fields</b>? <br>

              In most cases, it's best to have Einstein consider all lead fields.
              There are some kinds of fields you might choose to have Einstein ignore.
            </li>


            <li>

              Should I tell Einstein to <b> ignore any lead fields</b>? <br>

              Some businesses use fields that don’t affect the lead’s chance of converting.
              For example, you might have a field that isn’t used until after a lead converts.
              <br>
              Telling Einstein to ignore those fields yields more accurate lead scores
              <br>
              Before ignoring a field, make sure the field doesn't affect the lead's chance of converting.
              Ignoring fields that do affect lead quality decreases the accuracy of your lead scores.
              <br>
            </li>
            <li><b>How long</b> it takes to analyze your lead conversion history?
              It can take up to<b> 24 hours to analyze your lead conversion history</b> and your current leads.
            </li>
          </ul>

          ## EA discovery
          - Using Einstein Discovery is like having a personal data scientist doing the heavy lifting to speed up your
          work.
          - Every dataset tells a story. But it’s difficult to excavate that story when you’re dealing with **enormous
          tables of data and many variables with complex relationships**.
          - Example: shrinking margins in an auto parts supply company.
          - To do a thorough analysis, you need to consider not just inventory, but also particular **markets,
          distributors, incentives, and likely many other factors**.
          - analyzes huge amounts of data to expose correlations that we can investigate
          - shows us where to look for solutions, and predicts what might happen based on these correlations.

          ### Key points

          - quickly sift through huge amounts of data (EA dataset) to find:
          - the important correlations
          - make accurate predictions
          - generates answers, explanations, and recommendations in a way that is easy for business users to understand

          - finds the patterns
          - What was significant or unusual?
          - Why did it happen? What are the factors that possibly contributed to the observed outcome?
          - How do some factors compare with other factors?
          - What might happen in the future, based on a **statistical analysis** of the data?
          - Is there a trend, or does this data represent an isolated one-off incident?
          - Actions
          - What are some possible actions that could improve the outcome?


          ### Example
          - what’s driving profitability by figuring out ways in which we can improve margin

          - Use case:
          - The company’s CFO started it to find out why, all of a sudden, company margins are headed south. Then the
          CEO chimes in: “We must solve this issue immediately!”
          - input: transactions across different regions and verticals

          - How to:
          - open up Analytics Studio, grab the Einstein Analytics dataset that contains the relevant data
          - tell it the variable (business metric) you want to learn about.
          - Minutes later, you get a story:
          - represents a comprehensive **statistical analysis** of your dataset.
          - provides insights about your data that pertain to the outcome variable you're interested in (margin)
          - possible underlying causes and relationships among possible influencers
          - anticipates what to expect next based on a predictive analysis of your dataset
          - suggests ways in which you might improve the outcome.

          ### Steps
          - In EA, Create > Dataset
          ![Dataset creation-1](../ea/discovery/img/ead-1.png)
          ![Dataset creation-2](../ea/discovery/img/ead-2.png)
          ![Dataset creation-3](../ea/discovery/img/ead-3.png)

          - What Happened to Our Margins?

          - Create Story for the dataset APDist
          ![Story creation-1](../ea/discovery/img/ead-create-story-1.png)
          - Based on the data in your dataset, Einstein Discovery suggests creating a story to “Maximize the variable
          Margin.”
          ![Story creation-2](../ea/discovery/img/ead-create-story-2.png)
          - How do I maximize margins? And that question lines up with the most pressing question you have: What
          happened to lower our margins?

          - Click [Data Options]. In the next screen, you tell Einstein which fields to use to create the story.
          ![Story creation-3](../ea/discovery/img/ead-create-story-3.png)

          ### Get the Big Picture from Stories

          - AcquiredAccount.csv has 11 columns: Account Id, BillingState, Division, Industry, Ownership, Rating, Type,
          AccountScore, StartDate, CloseDate, and CLV(Customer lifetime value). The CSV file contains one row of
          information for each of the 10,000 different companies that our auto parts manufacturing company does business
          with. Here is what the first few rows of the CSV file look like:

          - Customer lifetime value (CLV) is a metric that predicts the profitability over the entire lifetime of the
          company’s relationship with a customer.
          - CLV helps to find the group of customers who are potentially the most profitable. That way, more marketing
          resources can be allocated to them.

          - Goals: maximizing margin or minimizing cost
          - Result: answers, explanations, and recommendations arranged into an organized presentation with a logical
          flow and related sections

          ##### What Happened - insights
          - descriptive insights that tell you more about what happened according to the data in the dataset.

          - explains statistically, the most variation in the outcome variable.
          - uses bar charts to help you visualize What Happened insights.

          - CLV is the outcome variable in your story, and maximizing CLV is your goal.

          - All the insights in this story show you how **different variables and combinations of variables** explain
          variations in CLV.

          - The top insights in the list reflect the most statistically significant variations in the outcome variable.

          - T-Test:
          - For each category in the Einstein Analytics dataset, Einstein Discovery performs a statistical calculation
          called a t-test to find out whether the category is **statistically significant**.
          - The t-test helps to identify categories that exhibit patterns that are statistically different from the
          other categories.
          - For example, for the category called Naval, the first step is to split the data into two groups: **Naval and
          not Naval**. The second step is to use the t-test to determine whether these two groups are statistically
          different.

          - What is t-test?
          - invented by William Sealy Gosset
          - [paper](img/probable-error-of-a-mean.pdf)
          - checks if 2 means (averages) are reliably different from each other
          - it is an inferential statistics (instead descriptive statistics)
          - Not only describe our sample but also tell us about new samples that we do not have even
          - So allow us to take inferences (generalize the findings ) about whole population beyond our data we have
          - t = (variance between groups) / (variance within the group)
          - big t value : different groups
          - small t value : similar groups

          - Division is the variable that explains the most variation in CLV.
          - This type of insight, called a **first-order analysis**, examines how one variable (Division) explains
          variation in the outcome variable (CLV).

          - The key takeaway from this insight is that Division explains 14.2% of the variation in CLV. Einstein
          Discovery did a statistical calculation to find the coefficient of determination, R2 (R squared). R2 tells you
          how much Division explains variation of the outcome variable (CLV)—in other words, how much predictive power
          the Division variable has. More observations describe other factors that affect CLV.

          ![first-order
          analysis](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/understand_einstein_discovery_stories/understand_descriptive/images/25a267238d989aefec9fdc186833501b_what_happened_graph.png)


          - CLV is the vertical axis and Division is the horizontal axis.
          The orange horizontal line in the chart shows the average CLV, which is just above 20 K.
          - Blue bars show variables that extend further above and below the average CLV—the most interesting
          correlations. Of these divisions, Raw Materials and Mapping are the most significantly above average, and
          Standard Hardware is the most significantly below average.
          - Gray bars show variables that are close to the average CLV. These divisions are statistically less
          significant and, therefore, are not listed in the explanatory text on the left. When considering gray bars,
          you can't assume that the differences from the other categories is meaningful.

          - In the blue curve, notice that more of the values are closer to the average. It has a smaller standard
          deviation. In the yellow curve, the values are more spread out, and therefore it has a larger standard
          deviation.

          #### View a Second-Order Analysis


          - This is a refinement of the first insight discussed previously, CLV by Division. It adds a second variable,
          When Type is Consulting, meaning that the combination of the two variables (CLV is Division and Type is
          Consulting) gives a strong signal.

          ![2nd

          - Notice that what stands out first in the chart is the blue bar above Naval, which shows that Consulting is
          highest when Division is Naval.

          ![2nd -
          2](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/understand_einstein_discovery_stories/understand_descriptive/images/427a456ed5b56d984b28f9c4aff4df98_what_happened_second_retail.png)


          - There are two bars for each division. The bar on the left represents the division's average value when only
          the retail industry is included. The bar on the right represents the average value for the division when all
          industries except retail are included. Comparing these bars lets you see how differently this pairing behaves.

          - The reason that Einstein Discovery flags this insight is that this particular industry, Retail, behaves
          differently from the rest of the population, with regard to Division. In this case, each bar refers to a
          Division when Industry is Retail. When we compare each division against the rest of the population, we compare
          that division in the retail industry versus that division in all other industries. If those two groups are
          statistically different, the bar is highlighted in blue.

          - 2,450: that is the difference between Standard Hardware when Industry is Retail and Standard Hardware in all
          other industries.

          ### What Is The Difference insights

          - are comparative insights that help you better understand the relationships between explanatory variables and
          the goal (target outcome variable) in your story.

          - help you figure out which factors contribute to the biggest changes in the outcome variable.
