## Q & A 

1.  We have to  enable **Extended use of IE11 with Lightning Experience** to install Salesforce for Outlook (SFO). The  users use Chrome for Lightning Experience.
Do the users face any performance issues by setting this on?

![ie11 settings](img/ie11/ie11-settings-1.png)

- Users will **not** face any performance issue as long as the user is accessing Lightning Experience with Chrome. But the user will face performance issue when using IE 11.
- With this setting on, Salesforce will **not** display this message **You can't access Lightning Experience** when the user access Lightning Experience with IE 11
![ie11 can't access](img/ie11/ie11-cant-access.png)

 but allow the user to access Lightning Experience as shown here:

![ie11 can't access](img/ie11/ie-11-lex.png)

and user will have performance issue with this user agent (IE11 in this case) as explained [here](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000318634&type=1&mode=1)

3. What is the User Agent String for IE 11 ?

```

```

4. What are the issues with IE 11 with respect to Lightning Experience?

- IE 11 is significantly slower for Lightning Experience compared to Classic. Pages load much more slowly.
- IE 11 is also significantly slower than modern browsers for Lightning Experience.  As a result, we strongly recommend using other browsers as explained [here](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=getstart_browsers_sfx.htm&type=5)


4. What happens when I **do not** enable  **Extended use of IE11 with Lightning Experience**  and user access Lighting Experience with IE 11?

- You will get the following error:
 ![ie11 can't access](img/ie11/ie11-cant-access.png)

and the user will be taken to Classic UI:

5. When is End-of-life (EOL) for IE 11 support for accessing Lightning Experience?
