## Grain Step

- Use the grain step type for a values table. 
- Values tables have no groupings, just a list of dataset fields to display as columns in the table.
- The query can be in compact form only
    -  can contain the following properties:
        -  filter conditions to apply to the data.
        -  values list of dataset fields to show as table columns
        -  limit


### Example

- If we want to have a filter like this:

```   

 "filters": [
                        [
                            "type", [ "Nut", "Fruit" ], "in"
                        ]
                    ]

```

- Binding should be like this 

```   
 "filters": [
      [

        "type", "{{selection(Typer_1)}}" , "in"

      ]

    ]
```
