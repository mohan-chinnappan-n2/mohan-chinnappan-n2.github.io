To use the **Before** version and manually add the code, follow the procedures in the article linked to above. Then go on to each subsequent stage in the tutorial. Each one links to its successor.

To work with the **Completed** version, follow all the steps in the **Setup** section of the tutorial setup stage (but substitute "Completed" for "Start" in the instructions, and then follow the steps in the **Test the add-in** section of each stage of the tutorial.

To work with the **VS_Solution** (which is also a completed version), simply clone (or download) this repo, open the *.sln file, and press F5 when Visual Studio opens. Then press **Show Taskpane** on the **Home** menu, and press each of the buttons in the taskpane in order from top to bottom.
