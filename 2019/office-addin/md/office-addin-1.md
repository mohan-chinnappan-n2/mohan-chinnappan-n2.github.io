## Microsoft Add-In Development

### What is Office Add-ins 
- Office Add-ins run inside an Office application and can interact with the contents of the Office document using the rich JavaScript API.

- Office Add-in is just a web app that you can host anywhere
- Using a manifest.xml file, you tell the Office application where your web app is located and how you want it to appear
