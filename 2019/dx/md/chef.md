## Chef

- Continuous Automation software help to deliver software at speed.
- Helps to streamline the task of configuring and maintaining a company's servers, and can integrate with cloud-based platforms to automatically provision and configure new machines 
 
- The user writes "recipes" that describe how Chef manages server applications and utilities  and how they are to be configured

- The recipe describe a series of resources that should be in a particular state: 
    - packages that should be installed, services that should be running, or files that should be written
    - These various resources can be configured to specific versions of software to run and can ensure that software is installed in the correct order based on dependencies.
    - Chef makes sure each resource is properly configured and corrects any resources that are not in the desired state.
