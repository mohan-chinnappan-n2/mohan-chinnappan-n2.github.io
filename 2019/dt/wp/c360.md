### Customer 360

Customer 360 helps you transform your business by bringing your customers and your company together.

#### How it works?
 With one integrated CRM platform, Salesforce helps you break down the silos between your:
  - marketing, 
  - sales, 
  - commerce, 
  - service,
  -  IT teams

 by giving everyone:

 -  a single, shared view of your customers. 

This empowers your teams to work as one to get:

 -  a clearer understanding of each customer, respond faster to their needs, and predict new opportunities. And more important, they can deliver the personalized experiences your customers expect to build lasting, trusted relationships.


All the capabilities of CRM -  the trusted platform â€“ from AI to analytics to integration  can be easily tailored to your specific industry needs.
