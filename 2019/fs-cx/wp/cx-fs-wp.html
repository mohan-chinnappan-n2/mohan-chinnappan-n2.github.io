    <p class="c4"><span class="c15"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c3">Today&rsquo;s customers are more tech-savvy and their expectations are different and
            they demand new commitment to Customer Experience (CX) and game-changing innovations in Financial Services.
            The half of the world&rsquo;s population will be digital natives by 2020 and they never lived in a
            non-digital world. Each connected customer owns around 3 connected devices on average. It is estimated that
            US adults will spend around 3 hours a day using a mobile device this year. Their financial services
            experiences shouldn&rsquo;t force them to relive their parents&rsquo; non-digital world. They expect
            gamification for the learning and engagement that makes financial services activities more fun. They expect
             more relevant, engaging, welcoming and effective digital experiences. They do not want to repeat who they
            are and what they want when serviced. 
            In this paper, we explain how Salesforce Unified Platform can help businesses to meet and exceed these needs and 
            enable customer success.

    <p class="c5"><span class="c3">By 2020, 85% of customer interactions will be automated as per Gartner. Customers
            prefer web or mobile self-service over speaking with an agent by phone. Customers are getting more

    <p class="c5 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c3">Customers will rely on digital tools for most of their service needs and want to
            manage transactions and solve problems on their own. Customers don&rsquo;t want to get online, click around,
            and end up calling an 1-800 number that routes them through an array of service reps. They expect to have
            how-to-do videos in place of traditional written content to understand products and services. </span></p>

   <h3>Here is how the products in Salesforce Unified Customer 360 Platform  can help you to take care of Gartner's  Customer 360 ten key take-aways :</h3>
    <ul class='list-group striped-list2'>
        <li class='list-group-item'>
        1.  In the digital age, every interaction has to wow the customer.
        With few differentiators left and empowered customers eager to share, a standout
        customer experience (CX) matters more than ever.

        <ul class='list-group striped-list'> 
                <li class='list-group-item sf-item' >Community Cloud</li>
                <li class='list-group-item sf-item' >Commerce Cloud</li>
        </ul>

        </li>
        <li class='list-group-item'>
        2. An enterprisewide CRM vision will see you through rapid change.
        To thrive in a climate of high-speed change, craft an enterprise-wide customer
        experience vision and a strategy to make it real.

        <ul class='list-group striped-list'> 
                <li class='list-group-item sf-item' >Sales Cloud</li>
                <li class='list-group-item sf-item' >Service Cloud</li>
        </ul>

        </li>
        
        <li class='list-group-item'>
        3. Analytics is a game-changer, but implementation can be tricky.
        Customer analytics can enable richly relevant interactions. The best results depend on
        leading-edge information management strategies.
        <ul class='list-group striped-list'> 
                <li class='list-group-item sf-item' >Einstein Analytics</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li class='list-group-item'>
        4. To seize new marketing opportunities, integration is key.
        Integrated multichannel marketing hubs orchestrate efforts across touch points to
        maximize results and avoid a disjointed customer experience.
        <ul class='list-group striped-list'> 
                <li class='list-group-item sf-item' >Marketing Cloud</li>
                <li class='list-group-item sf-item' >MuleSoft</li>
                <li class='list-group-item sf-item' >Heroku Kafka</li>
                <li class='list-group-item sf-item' >Quip</li>


               

        </ul>

        
        </li>
        <li class='list-group-item'>
        5. New technologies are forcing a customer service overhaul.
        With sensors, location services, Web self-service, Twitter, Facebook, video and
        mobile-everything in the mix, customer service needs a major reboot.
        <ul class='list-group striped-list'> 
                <li class='list-group-item sf-item' >Service Cloud</li>
        </ul>

        </li>
        
        <li class='list-group-item'>
        6. Personal analytics promise new opportunities.
        The quantified self will soon have a major impact on your customer relationships.
        Now is the time to consider what it will mean for your business.
        <ul class='list-group striped-list'> 
                <li class='list-group-item sf-item' >Einstein Analytics</li>
        </ul>

        </li>
        
        <li class='list-group-item'>
        7. Social engagement must be strategic to deliver results.
        Anchoring social strategy firmly to organizational and performance goals helps it live
        up to its potential.
        <ul class='list-group striped-list'> 
                <li class='list-group-item sf-item' >Sales Cloud</li>
                <li class='list-group-item sf-item' >Service Cloud</li>
                <li class='list-group-item sf-item' >Marketing Cloud</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li class='list-group-item striped-list'>
        8. New mobile sales tools can deliver real business value.
        The latest mobile technologies are enabling new value-added selling processes,
        improving sales effectiveness and helping sales teams achieve revenue targets.

        <ul class='list-group striped-list'> 
                <li class='list-group-item sf-item' >Salesforce App</li>
                <li class='list-group-item sf-item' >Heroku</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li class='list-group-item'>
        9. For just-right personalization, look to adaptive analytics.
        Adaptive analytics is taking personalization — balanced with privacy — to a whole new
        level, creating a “segment of one” that makes customers feel valued.
        <hr/>
        Adaptive analytics are useful for both the marketing and sales teams.
        Adaptive analytics can help inform each team when it’s optimal to engage and with what content.
        Predictive analytics looks at your customer data and, based on certain traits like firmographics,
         tells you which prospects look most like your existing customer base, and are therefore more likely to be qualified.


        <ul class='list-group striped-list'> 
                <li class='list-group-item sf-item' >Marketing Cloud</li>
                <li class='list-group-item sf-item' >Einstein Analytics</li>


        </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li class='list-group-item'>
        10. Customer-facing analytics is a win-win for CRM.
        Customers want greater transparency. Delivering it enables greater personalization and
        can create new data-driven business opportunities.
        <hr/>
        Customer-facing analytics let companies increase their competitive edge by enhancing the customer experience (CX), 
        increasing loyalty and retention, reducing service and support cost.
        <ul class='list-group striped-list'> 
                <li class='list-group-item sf-item' >Service Cloud</li>
                <li class='list-group-item sf-item' >Service Analytics</li>
                <li class='list-group-item sf-item' >Community Cloud</li>
