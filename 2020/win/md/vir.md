## Hosted Virtual Desktop (HVD)
- A Windows 7/XP/10 desktop running as a virtual machine where a single user connects remotely. 
- One user’s desktop is not impacted by another user’s desktop configurations. 
- Think of this as one user to one desktop. 
- There are many flavors for the hosted virtual desktop model (existing, installed, pooled, dedicated and streamed), but they are all located within the data center.


### Hosted Shared Desktops: 
- A published desktop on XenApp. 
- Users get a desktop interface, which can look like Windows 7. 
- However, that desktop is actually being shared by every user on the server. 
- Although we can configure restrictions and redirections to allow users to have a smaller impact on each other, there is still a risk. Many users to one desktop.
