# Peg Parser for Python

## LL(1) parser
- A grammar can be said to be LL(1) if it can be parsed by an LL(1) parser, which in turn is defined as
    -  a top-down parser that parses the input from **L**eft to Right, performing leftmost derivation of the sentence, 
    - with just **1** token of **lookahead**

- produce a **parse table** 
    - which encodes the possible transitions between all possible **states** of the parser
    - These tables are normally constructed from the **first sets** and the follow sets of the grammar
        -  **first set** is the collection of all **terminals** that can occur first in a full derivation of that rule.
```
rule: A | B
```
- if only A can start with the terminal a and only B can start with the terminal b and the parser sees the token b when parsing this rule, it knows that it needs to follow the non-terminal B.
