<div id='change-md' class='md' data-trim='true'>
 - Salesforce Edge Network brings Salesforce Services **closer to the user** on the trusted Salesforce infrastructure. It ensures requests land sooner to the trusted Salesforce infrastructure and can take advantage of the caching and transport optimizations that Salesforce Edge Network provides on the dedicated high-bandwidth links between Salesforce locations. 

Caching is limited to only the content with http headers marked as **cacheable** by either the core app or by customer integrationsâ€”this is typically content such as JavaScript and CSS files.

### End Users
- Move is seamless for your end users and no actions are required from them. They keep using the same URLs to access your org, Salesforce Sites, or Communities. 
### Administrators of Salesforce orgs
- Ensure your org is using a **My Domain**
- When setting a **My Domain name**, please use the same My Domain name between your production org and its sandbox orgs. Salesforce does not enforce this naming consistency today, but it may in a future release.
- If your corporate network settings or email security filters restrict access to IP ranges or addresses, please ensure that you include our current ranges. All of our current IP ranges are available in the article [What are the Salesforce IP Addresses & Domains to whitelist?](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000321501&type=1)
