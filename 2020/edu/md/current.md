## Paint Points of current system (oEdu) to be fixed in new (nEdu) system

- Students do not know what they are going to get out of oEdu
- oEdu is too **long** process to give fruits to students as well to the society
- Broad, not deep
    - Students end up knowing vaguely many things and not enough to create/invent new things
    - Innovation rate suffers
    - Most of the trailblazers who created new things got out in the middle and went to pursue their passion of invention

- Not updated
    - Out-of-date-system, begging for major update/upgrade

- Teachers are *not* trained to propose what students can do after learning  topic/subject
    - Teachers are not trained to be a catalyst in creating innovators
    - Just teaching a subject,  say for example, Differential calculus is not enough
        - Teacher should give areas it will be useful in student's life say Machine Learning, Farming Optimization, Animations...
            - This will make get the light bulbs go on for the students and get 100% absorption rate

- Life essentials are *not* given importance
    - Language skill is a must to have, once they know mother tongue and technical language like English, French..., they can expand their horizons 
    - Respecting the nature is not taught in the early stages
        - Understanding the nature is key ingredient to any student's innovation path 
        - This will help them to prepare the better world to the next generations to come

    - Farming:
        - Short vision: Students do not even know where the food they had few hours ago came from? Most of them think it is from a  local fridge or a remote grocery store. Farming has not received proper importance in our education system, which is the biggest flaw. Only some of the  current farmers take the journey of learning Farming. Without investing in Farming we will head to a disastrous future.
            - Knowing Farming and practicing farming will give students a morale boost and a feeling that they can **create** great things when family, friends and society can benefit from. This will put a seed to the students mind that **they can do things**. Appreciation out this task will take the student to the next level of the innovation path. Life of [Henry Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford) can be a good example - a farm boy who changed the automotive map of the world!

    - Carpentry - We are not teaching this essential trade to students now.
        - Teaching carpentry will provide skills needed for student in the life like building a house for the students and the society. This will give a sense of accomplishment and self-confidence which will be the pillars for the student's innovation path.
    
    - How human body functions to create health society
        - We do not teach key things like the food we eat is getting digested to provide energy to our bodies and mind
            - Things like how to chew and mix with saliva (80% of the digestion process) our food
            - What type of food is suitable for each one of us
                - one size does **not** fit all
            - How many times you can eat 
            - When they can eat (like 2 meals a day - 10 am and 7 pm, eat only when hungry, instead of dumping!)
            - Importance of consuming enough water is not taught in the schools now
                - Consuming right amount of water at right time will reduce the burden on our healthcare system
        - Exercise, Yoga, Pilates, Mediation are not taught to students at early ages (start from age 4 or 5)
        - Importance of sleep is not taught to students
            - how long 
            - when to when 

    - Electricity
        - Fundamentals of the electricity is not taught at early stages. It is viewed a black box or magical power to many students. This need to be changed, knowing how to fix and build electrical circuits is must to have. This will take the students to new innovation paths.

    - Memory based education has to go!
        - We need to make students learn things by providing contexts (where it is used, benefits of learning this) while teaching a subject which need put anchors in their mind about the subject. This way, we can retire current memory based testing used in oEdu for the testing the students knowledge in the subject.

    - College education is too costly and not affordable
        - Human society **should not have profit making notion** in noble acts like
            - eduction 
            - take care of society members health
            - Currently colleges are like profit making business machinery 
                - Investing lavishly in things which do not build the correct foundations for our students 
        - We should figure out ways to provide free education to all and pay the costs involved with valuable goods produced by the students and teachers while they are in the college. This will free the minds of the students and teachers. **Free mind and health body are key ingredients to the innovators!** 
        - Current eduction system is a pain to both students. We need to make it to fun for all!
