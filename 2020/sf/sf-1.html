- Salesforce is a cloud company. 
- Everything we offer resides in the trusted, multitenant cloud.
- The Salesforce platform is the foundation of our services. 
- It’s powered by metadata and made up of different parts, like data services, artificial intelligence, and robust APIs for development.
- All our apps sit on top of the platform. 
- Our prebuilt offerings like Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud, along with apps you build using the platform, have consistent, powerful functionality.
- Everything is integrated. 
- Our platform technologies like Einstein predictive intelligence and the Lightning framework for development are built into everything we offer and everything you build.
