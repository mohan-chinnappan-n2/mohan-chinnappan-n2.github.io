## Mobile Publisher
- Mobile Publisher is a powerful tool to help you fully brand your version of the Salesforce mobile app or Salesforce Lightning Communities. Your app icon, your name, your colors, and—most importantly—your very own listing in Google Play and Apple App store.

- Steps

    - Sign up for the Mobile Publisher program. Contact your Salesforce sales rep for more information.
    - Choose the Salesforce mobile app to brand(only one app can be branded per org).
    - Start a new Mobile Publisher project.
    - Design your branded assets and upload them along with your app information to Salesforce.
    - Request and install a special managed package for your branded app.
    - Receive and thoroughly test the beta version of your branded app. For example, test the beta version to make sure your branding looks correct on devices with different screen sizes.
    - Set up your preferred type of app distribution (Google or Apple).
    - Approve your branded app and Salesforce submits it to Google and Apple. The store approval process can take from one day to two weeks depending on the app.
    - See your branded app listed in Google Play and the Apple App Store
