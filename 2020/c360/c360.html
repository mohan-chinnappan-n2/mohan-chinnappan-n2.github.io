<div id='c360flow-md' class='md' data-trim='false'>
- When a service agent accesses the agent console, the console will provide a unified profile of the customer, giving the agent the most accurate and up-to-date information,  including orders placed and open cases
- When the agent console appears and is queried for information on a customer, it will access data for that individual from connected systems based on the relationship created via the Customer 360 ID, the Salesforce Information Model and the metadata associated with it.
    - Customer 360 Data Manager has pulled all this different information from various systems to give the agent her single view of the customer. Now the agent has an accurate snapshot of her customer and can use that to deliver better service.
