## Create Communities Users

- To allow an external user to access your community
    - add the user to an account as a contact record. 
        - Only business accounts (and not person accounts) can be **partner accounts**
        - You can use only **partner accounts** to create partner users.
    - enable the contact record as a customer user or partner user
        - Enable a contact record as an external user
        - Assign a Partner Community, Customer Community, or Customer Community Plus license 

- You can only configure the **Log in to Community as User** action on the contact layout using Lightning Experience. 
- After you enable a partner or customer user in Salesforce Classic, **Log in to Community as User** is available on the **contact record**

### Steps
1. On the **account** record
    -  view or add the **contact** record for the **person** you want to add to a community.
2. On the contact detail page, click Manage External User, then select Enable Partner User or Enable Customer User.
This option creates a user record in your Salesforce org with some details prepopulated from the contact record.
