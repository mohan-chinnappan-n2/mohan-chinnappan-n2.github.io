<google-codelab-step label="DNS CNAME" duration="1">
<div id='cname-md' class='md' data-trim='false'>

- Update your company domain DNS records to include CNAME as shown below:

```
mycompany.com                                         A  12.33.3.33    
[domain].[18 character OrgID].live.siteforce.com  CNAME   mycompany.com

```
</div>

 <google-codelab-step label="Importance TTL" duration="1">
<div id='ttl-md' class='md' data-trim='false'>
-  TTL (Time to Live) is a setting for each DNS record that specifies how long a resolver is supposed to cache (or remember) the DNS query before the query expires and a new one needs to be done.
- Benefit
    -  it’s a lot faster to check your local resolver’s cache then having to look up a DNS record that isn’t already cached. 
- Drawback
    - When you hear someone mentioning they are waiting for DNS to propagate, they are waiting for cached DNS records to expire at all of the different resolvers that previously looked it up. If you have a 1-day TTL on a record, that means it would take a full day for any change to propagate around the world.

- Balance
    - You want to strike the best balance between having a low TTL (enabling fast changes when needed) and high TTLs (taking advantage of DNS caching).
    - For very critical records that can change often or need to change in an emergency, you can set TTLs as low as 30 seconds
    -  A good rule of thumb is never have any TTL higher than 1 day as the benefits of DNS caching really diminish after that point and it makes propagation waits extremely long.
    -  TTL changes also need propagate out just like any other DNS change.

- With Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning for Communities, you can use a SAML assertion to **create customer and partner community users on the fly** the first time they try to log in from an identity provider. 
- This eliminates the need to create user accounts in advance. Because JIT uses SAML to communicate, your organization must have SAML-based single sign-on enabled. Then, you can work with the identity provider to generate the necessary SAML assertions for JIT.

<google-codelab-step label="User Creation" duration="1">
<div id='usercreation-md' data-trim='false' class='md'> 
- To allow an external user to access your community
    - add the user to an account as a contact record. 
        - Only business accounts (and not person accounts) can be **partner accounts**
        - You can use only **partner accounts** to create partner users.
    - enable the contact record as a customer user or partner user
        - Enable a contact record as an external user
        - Assign a Partner Community, Customer Community, or Customer Community Plus license 

- You can only configure the **Log in to Community as User** action on the contact layout using Lightning Experience. 
- After you enable a partner or customer user in Salesforce Classic, **Log in to Community as User** is available on the **contact record**

### Steps
1. On the **account** record
    -  view or add the **contact** record for the **person** you want to add to a community.
2. On the contact detail page, click Manage External User, then select Enable Partner User or Enable Customer User.
This option creates a user record in your Salesforce org with some details prepopulated from the contact record.
