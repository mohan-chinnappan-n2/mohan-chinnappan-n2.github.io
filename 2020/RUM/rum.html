- Real User Monitoring (RUM) provides performance monitoring of Web pages based on data collected from real end users. 
- With RUM we are able to gather data about an individual page request, and send that data back for processing.

- RUM collects the following types of information:

    - Performance metrics
    - Dimension data, which describe properties of the request, such as
        - Browser
        - Platform used
        - Geography
        - Features used with the request

- 90th Percentile	
    - An aggregation method generally used for large sets of data, where 90% of the data points are smaller and 10% are larger. Removing the top 10% is seen to eliminate data points that are far outside the norm.  In terms of user experience, 90% of all users experience a time below this number.

- Aggregation method
	- A measure of statistical distribution.
- Bar Chart	
    -A graph that uses vertical (or horizontal) bars to compare data categories against a value or metric.
- Dimension	
    - For RUM, dimensions describe properties of the request, such as the browser used, or which features were used.
    -   Within a dimension are various values. For example, a continent dimension may include the following five values: Asia (AS), Australia (Oceania–OC), Europe (EU), North America (NA), and South America (SA).

- Histogram	
    - Histograms provide a visual interpretation of numerical data. They indicate the number of data points that lie within a range of values. The ranges are configurable between 0.1, 0,5, 1, and 2 seconds.
- Median	
    - An aggregation method for the “middle” value in a list of numbers. The median value is one where 50% of the values are larger, and 50% are smaller.
- Metric	
    - A metric is a standard for measuring or evaluating something that is expressed in a numerical value.
    - Navigation Timing metrics

- Navigation 
    - Timing	A specification from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) used to define a JavaScript-based performance timing interface for use with Web applications. 

- Pie Chart	
    - A pie chart is a graphic in which each slice area is proportional to the quantity it represents.
