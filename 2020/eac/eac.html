![EAC-1](img/eac-0.png)
- Einstein Activity Capture (EAC) connects to Gmail or Office 365, automatically syncing all of your team’s customer communications to Salesforce
-  When reps send and receive emails and calendar events, EAC adds the messages to appropriate records in Salesforce – no manual data entry required. 
-  All of the captured messages are visible in **Activity Timeline** within Salesforce, providing context for your entire team so they can help to close the deal.
- Once your team’s activity data is flowing into Salesforce, Sales Cloud Einstein analyzes the data stream.
    - Machine learning algorithms uncover Einstein Opportunity and Account Insights that guide reps to the **next best action**.
- Then activity reporting enables managers to discover why top reps are winning, so they can coach the rest of the team.

 <google-codelab-step label="How it works?" duration="1">
<div id='works-md' class='md' data-trim='false'>
- To get started, connect a Gmail or Office 365 account
- EAC  will begin by logging historical emails and calendar events
    - from up to six months back for Gmail 
    -  up to two years back for Office 365 
- Then, going forward, EAC will work **in the background** to passively capture
    -  every email or calendar event sent or received 

- The captured emails and events are all displayed in the **Activity Timeline**
    -  providing a history of the team’s relationship with a customer

- Once collected, EAC associates emails and events with the right records in Salesforce,
    - including Leads, Contacts, Accounts, Person Accounts, and Opportunities. 
- It looks at the email addresses of the sender and all recipients and finds matching records within Salesforce
    -  including records mapped through relationships

 <google-codelab-step label="Privacy" duration="1">
<div id='privacy-md' class='md' data-trim='false'>
- To protect privacy and ensure confidential messages aren’t shared across the organization
    -  EAC has built-in controls at the user and admin level
        - Users can adjust the sharing settings to determine who in their organization can see the contents of emails or
events. 
- Admins can blacklist specific domains or email addresses to prevent EAC from collecting messages from sensitive sources 
    -  for example: an investor or board member.
