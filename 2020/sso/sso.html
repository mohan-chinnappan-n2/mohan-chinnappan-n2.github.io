- Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID and password to any of several related, yet independent, software systems. 
- It is often accomplished by using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)

- User experience: 
    - The users can move between services securely and uninterrupted without specifying their credentials each time. SSO effectively joins these individual services into portals and removes the service boundaries 
- Security
    - The user's credentials are provided directly to the central SSO server, not the actual service that the user is trying to access, and therefore the credentials cannot be cached by the service. The central authentication point – the SSO service – limits the possibility of phishing.

- Resource savings
    -  IT administrators can save their time and resources by utilizing the central web access management service  Application and web developers receive a complete authentication and authorization framework that they can use to built secure, user customized services.

- Single sign-on where you log in to one system and then get access to everything you need to make your workday better
- At Saleforce, we realized huge cost avoidance by switching to our Identity solution - Salesforce Identity
- Time saved for the user
    - On average, using Salesforce Identity saves thousands of dollars in cost savings per user. 
    - Reduction in the number of total application logins per day per user. 
    - Significant reduction in password reset specific help desk calls
    - Cuts down on password re-use and helps us ensure that when an employee leaves, their access is also revoked from a single point.
-  Using Single Sign On with Multi-factor Authentications having Salesforce Identity greatly enhances our ability to prevent major events such as an intrusion and data breach.
