<google-codelab-step label="Salesforce Data in Snowflake with Sync Out (Beta)" duration="1">
  <div id='ea-sf-md' class='md' data-trim='false'>
-  Sync Out for Snowflake exports your raw local Salesforce data via Analytics to Snowflake using the Einstein Analytics connector for Snowflake. 
-  Keep your Salesforce data in Snowflake up-to-date using scheduled Data Sync without the need for a third-party ETL tool.
- Contact your Salesforce account representative to enable Sync Out for Snowflake.
- Turn on Sync Out for Snowflake in Analytics Setup
-  On the Connect tab of the Data Manager, click Connect to Data. Add a connection on the Output Connections tab and configure it with your **Snowflake account information**.
- ![output connections](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter21/release-notes/release_notes/images/rn_bi_create_output_connection.png) 
- ![ old](img/ea-op-1.png)
- Back on the Connect tab, find the local Salesforce connection with data you want to export to Snowflake. For our example, this local connection includes the account object. Select the down arrow (Down arrow.) next to the connection and click Sync Out.

- ![sf synout  connect](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter21/release-notes/release_notes/images/rn_bi_sync_out.png)
- Back on the Connect tab, find the local Salesforce connection with data you want to export to Snowflake. For our example, this local connection includes the account object. Select the down arrow (Down arrow.) next to the connection and click Sync Out.

- ![sync out](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter21/release-notes/release_notes/images/rn_bi_sync_out.png)
- Sync Out runs as the data sync completes for each local object. For our example, after Data Sync pulls data from the account object into Analytics, Sync Out would then push the same account data to Snowflake.

- Design powerful Data Prep recipes that combine data from multiple sources, add formula fields, and transform data into datasets tailored to your business needs. 
- With the EA connector for Snowflake, datasets are written as a table for you without the need to rebuild relationships and business logic. 
- On the Connect tab of the Data Manager, click Connect to Data. Add a connection on the Output Connections tab and configure it with your Snowflake account information.
- ![r sf out](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter21/release-notes/release_notes/images/rn_bi_connect_snowflake.png)
- Build your recipe with Data Prep. In an Output node, select to write to the Output Connection (1). Choose the Snowflake connection to push data to (2) and the Snowflake object that receives the data (3). Map recipe columns to their equivalent external object columns (4).
- ![r sf out2](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter21/release-notes/release_notes/images/rn_bi_recipe_output_node_snowflake.png)

- ![new ui](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter21/release-notes/release_notes/images/bi_integrate_recipe_large.png)
- Each object shown in the graph is called a node. A recipe can have multiple Input, Aggregate, Append, Filter, Join, Transform, and Output nodes.
