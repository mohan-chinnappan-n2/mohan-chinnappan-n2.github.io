<google-codelab-step label="Optimizer" duration="1">
<div id='so-md' class='md' data-trim='false'>

- Analyze your implementation to find ways to simplify customizations and drive feature adoption. Consider running Salesforce Optimizer as part of your **monthly maintenance**, before installing a new app, before each Salesforce release, or at least once a quarter


  - The Optimizer App now has even more capabilities to enhance your Salesforce org’s implementation. 
  - Use two new features to schedule automatic runs and view org metric history and access seven new metrics to improve security.
  - ![do more with optimizer](img/w21-so-1.gif)

- NOTE: Salesforce may analyze the usage data of the Orgs that have Optimizer enabled for the purpose of providing recommendations based on aggregated and anonymized usage data. No Customer Data or data that would identify customers, their users, their consumers, or any individual, company, or organization will be shared. By enabling Optimizer, you consent to Salesforce’s use of the usage data of your Org for this purpose, including to provide recommendations to other users. Upon disabling Optimizer, Salesforce will no longer analyze the usage data of your Org for this purpose.

<google-codelab-step label="Salesforce Data in Snowflake with Sync Out (Beta)" duration="1">
  <div id='ea-sf-md' class='md' data-trim='false'>
-  Sync Out for Snowflake exports your raw local Salesforce data via Analytics to Snowflake using the Einstein Analytics connector for Snowflake. 
-  Keep your Salesforce data in Snowflake up-to-date using scheduled Data Sync without the need for a third-party ETL tool.
- Contact your Salesforce account representative to enable Sync Out for Snowflake.
- Turn on Sync Out for Snowflake in Analytics Setup
-  On the Connect tab of the Data Manager, click Connect to Data. Add a connection on the Output Connections tab and configure it with your **Snowflake account information**.
- ![output connections](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter21/release-notes/release_notes/images/rn_bi_create_output_connection.png) 
- ![ old](img/ea-op-1.png)
- Back on the Connect tab, find the local Salesforce connection with data you want to export to Snowflake. For our example, this local connection includes the account object. Select the down arrow (Down arrow.) next to the connection and click Sync Out.

- ![sf synout  connect](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter21/release-notes/release_notes/images/rn_bi_sync_out.png)
- Back on the Connect tab, find the local Salesforce connection with data you want to export to Snowflake. For our example, this local connection includes the account object. Select the down arrow (Down arrow.) next to the connection and click Sync Out.

- ![sync out](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter21/release-notes/release_notes/images/rn_bi_sync_out.png)
- Sync Out runs as the data sync completes for each local object. For our example, after Data Sync pulls data from the account object into Analytics, Sync Out would then push the same account data to Snowflake.

<google-codelab-step label="Write Your Einstein Analytics Datasets to Snowflake from Recipes" duration="1">
  <div id='ea-sf-r-md' class='md' data-trim='false'>
- Helps to push your prepared data from Analytics into Snowflake when you use Data Prep recipes.
- Design powerful Data Prep recipes that combine data from multiple sources, add formula fields, and transform data into datasets tailored to your business needs. 
- With the EA connector for Snowflake, datasets are written as a table for you without the need to rebuild relationships and business logic. 
- On the Connect tab of the Data Manager, click Connect to Data. Add a connection on the Output Connections tab and configure it with your Snowflake account information.
- ![r sf out](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter21/release-notes/release_notes/images/rn_bi_connect_snowflake.png)
- Build your recipe with Data Prep. In an Output node, select to write to the Output Connection (1). Choose the Snowflake connection to push data to (2) and the Snowflake object that receives the data (3). Map recipe columns to their equivalent external object columns (4).
- ![r sf out2](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter21/release-notes/release_notes/images/rn_bi_recipe_output_node_snowflake.png)
- Save the recipe. When the recipe runs, Analytics writes the outcome to Snowflake.

    </div>
 </google-codelab-step>

<google-codelab-step label="Prepare Data with the Next Generation of Data Prep" duration="1">
  <div id='ea-dp-r-md' class='md' data-trim='false'>
-  New intuitive, visual interface that allows you to build recipes with clicks.
- Use the new graphical view of a recipe to see at a glance where data comes from, how it flows through the recipe, and where the results are written.
- Validate the recipe as you build, preview how raw data is transformed every step of the way. 
- The new version of Data Prep is called Data Prep and the old version is called Data Prep Classic. 
- Shows only inputs (source data), appends, aggregates, filters, joins, and the outputs
- ![new ui](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter21/release-notes/release_notes/images/bi_integrate_recipe_large.png)
- Each object shown in the graph is called a node. A recipe can have multiple Input, Aggregate, Append, Filter, Join, Transform, and Output nodes.
- Although the graph doesn’t show individual data transformations, you can select a Transform node (1) in the graph to see its transformations in the details area (2).
- ![transfer node](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter21/release-notes/release_notes/images/bi_integrate_recipe_transform_details.png)
- As in Data Prep Classic, you can select a transformation step in the left panel to preview the results of that transformation in the Preview tab. And you can select any node in the graph to preview the results of that node.
- ![ previews](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter21/release-notes/release_notes/images/bi_integrate_transformation_step_preview.png)
- To create a Data Prep recipe, click Create Recipe in the Recipes tab of Data Manager.

<google-codelab-step label="Einstein Analytics Direct for Snowflake" duration="1">
  <div id='eadsf-md' class='md' data-trim='false'>
- With EA Direct, non-CRM data can remain in Snowflake and does not need to be moved into EA. 
- Instead, EA will directly query Snowflake allowing high-performance real-time exploration and insight delivery without waiting for data to complete a sync process.
- EA also has a high-performance, high-volume Snowflake connector that allows you to ingest, transform & enrich data. In general, we recommend bringing data into EA to allow for deeper integration but there are many scenarios where Snowflake Direct can help

### Use cases
- **Live insights**. Each time you open a dashboard or lens powered by one or more Snowflake direct queries, we send those queries straight to Snowflake. This allows for near real-time freshness on fast-changing data. It is also a good alternative if your EA data flows take a while to run.
- **Keep your EA data pipelines clutter-free**. By offloading to EA Direct where possible, you minimize the number of data flows to run ensuring your critical data flows get the resources they need.
- Want to **analyze semi-structured data (JSON, Parquet, XML)** from modern data sources? Snowflake provides native support for semi-structured data and EA Direct can help you query it.
- [More here](https://www.salesforceblogger.com/2020/09/01/live-customer-360-insights-using-snowflake-direct/)

### Steps
- 1. Create live connection 
- Live connections are optimized for live querying and separate from standard connections that are optimized for ETL.
![Live connection](https://i0.wp.com/www.salesforceblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png?w=1276&ssl=1)
- 2. Create one or more live datasets
- You will find ‘live datasets’ resemble EA datasets in many ways. In fact, ‘live dataset’ are the same as EA datasets with one major difference – **data remains** in the external data source and we are simply pointing to it. Each ‘live dataset’ can be added to an EA App to allow table-level access control.

![live datasets](https://i1.wp.com/www.salesforceblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-4.png?w=1276&ssl=1)
- 3. Expore
- Exploration should feel just like exploring an EA dataset. You can group/filter/aggregate fields, change visualizations, apply formatting & save the exploration or clip it to a dashboard.
![Explore](https://i1.wp.com/www.salesforceblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png?w=1276&ssl=1)


### Dashboards with live datasets
- Winter ’21 also adds direct query support for data source linking so you can connect fields from live datasets with fields from EA datasets to add interactivity with a few clicks.
![Live metrics](https://i1.wp.com/www.salesforceblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-5.png?w=1276&ssl=1)
- Above EA dashboard contains **live case metrics powered by Salesforce Direct**, order metrics using **Snowflake Direct** & **historical metrics** using queries running against EA datasets all in the same dashboard.

### Coming up
- More querying capabilities so that users can answer a broad range of questions on their external data. The ability to **execute custom SQL queries right within Explorer** will allow analysts and power users to leverage the full power of their **data warehouse** to answer any question, ad-hoc or curated. We also plan to support advanced querying such as formulas & joins using clicks not code to enable easier exploration.
- Extended metadata (XMD) support to allow for custom field labels & types.
- Actions, Subscriptions, Notifications & Watchlists on direct queries to drive engagement & actionability across your user base.

- For example in Wealth Management, if the Account Under Management (AUM) hits lower or higher threshold, the subscription/notification on this event to our direct query will notify the Rep to take actions. All we need will be a direct query to the source system via EA Direct (to Snowflake for example) and setting up Notifications/Subscriptions to capture and handle this event.

  </div>
</google-codelab-step>

<google-codelab-step label="ARC - Actionable Relationship Center" duration="1">
<div id='fsc-arc-md' class='md' data-trim='false'>
- Manage Complex Relationships and Related Lists
- Create and edit **account and contact relationships** and other related records in one convenient interface using ARC. 
- ARC displays complex relationships and related lists at-a-glance. 
- You can create and edit relationships and related records from the same interface. 
- ARC does nearly everything the Relationship Map component can do, and **displays related lists** also.
