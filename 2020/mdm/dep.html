- The Device Enrollment Program (DEP) helps businesses easily deploy and configure Apple devices.
- Provides a fast, streamlined way to deploy organization-owned iPad and iPhone devices, Mac computers, and Apple TV purchased directly from Apple or participating Apple Authorized Resellers or carriers. 

### Program Features 
-  Simplifies **initial setup** by **automating** mobile device management (MDM) enrollment and supervision of devices during setup, which enables you to **configure** your organization’s devices without touching them. 

- Mandatory and lockable MDM enrollment 
    - All iOS, macOS, and tvOS devices added to DEP will be enrolled automatically in MDM. 
    - Devices are configured based on your **organization’s requirements**, and guarantees that all users receive those configurations on their devices. 
    - Your users’ devices are also locked in MDM for ongoing management. 
- Wireless supervision 
    - provides a higher level of device management for organization-owned iOS devices.
    - **allows additional restrictions, such as turning off iMessage, AirDrop, or Game Center** 
    - additional device configurations and features, such as web content filtering and Single App Mode.
    - supervision is wirelessly enabled on a device as part of the setup process
- Zero-touch configuration for IT 
    - large-scale deployments of iPad, iPhone, Mac, and Apple TV are seamless
    - Once devices have been activated, you can immediately configure account settings, apps, and access to IT services over the air.
    - You don’t need to use staging services or physically access each device to complete the setup.
- Streamlined **Setup Assistant** 
    - Makes it easier for your users to set up their iOS devices, Mac computers, and Apple TV
    - Using a MDM solution to configure your organization’s devices, users are guided through the activation process with the built-in Setup Assistant. 
    - You can streamline the Setup Assistant even further by specifying that certain setup screens can be skipped
