- Cloud Spanner is a 
    - fully managed
    - mission-critical
    - **relational database service**
- Offers transactional consistency at global scale, schemas, SQL (ANSI 2011 with extensions), and automatic, synchronous replication for high availability.

### Life of a write

- Client lands on the load-balancers
- Then lands on Span Front-end
- Span Front-end takes the clients to the very first  Span Server
- Span server stores slices of the data (Paxos Groups) 
    - Paxos is a family of protocols for solving consensus in a network of unreliable processors
    - Paxos bring highly available participants
        - you can trust the participants to hold locks
        - building transaction with help of Paxos and TrueTime makes the Spanner unique
        - External Consistency
            - you can write to Spanner anywhere in the world
            - spanner will have consistent data at any point in time 
    - Data containers spread across multiple zones for availability
    - Commits has to go to 2 out of 3 or 3 out of 5 or some number (say n) forms **quorum**
        - Span Server in Zone-A takes the Write it gets, and will forward it to Zone-B and C
        - Span Server in Zone-A will wait until 2 of them comes back (one local and one of the others) and return back to the client
        - At this point it becomes **durable**
- Fully synchronously replicated database
    - Full copies of the data at least 3 availability zones
    - Copies of the data are in Colossus file system (Storage)
    - Data is always in the Storage layer
- Span servers are the Compute units that act on the data, responsible for serving the data.
    - If the request comes for the client, any of the compute unit can pick it up
    - Paxos is used to figure out who is the leader. 
    - Has no concept of master
- Colossus is a big distributed file system
- TrueTime is used to pickup a timestamp
- Timestamp is used for ordering - being externally consistent
    - If you 2 successive operations, they will get increasing timestamps
- Internally 1000s of Span servers are used

### Life of a read
- Reads does not need to go the leader
- Picks the timestamp ( NOW + epsilon) - time at which we know no writes have seen committed
- Front-end passes into a Span server
    - Span Server checks: Do I have all of the data up to that time?
        - Yes, returns the data
        - No, reaches out to the leader to get the data

### Trusting Time
- You can't trust time
    - clock on your server is absolutely something you can't trust
    - TrueTime provides the trusted time

- Spanner trades off partition tolerance for availability
- Has multi-tenancy support built in
- Horizontal scaling 
- 1000s databases running and competing for the same resources
