## Extend Access with Sharing Rules

- Your org-wide default (OWD) sharing settings give you a (relatively restrictive) baseline level of access for each object. 
- If you have org-wide sharing defaults (OWD) of **Public Read Only or Private**, 
    - you can **open access** back up for some users with **sharing rules**. 
- This enables you to make **automatic exceptions** to your org-wide sharing settings for **selected sets of users**.
