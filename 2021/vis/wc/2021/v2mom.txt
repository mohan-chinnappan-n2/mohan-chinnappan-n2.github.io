            * shelter (passive homes, net-zero, carbon-neutral homes)
            * education to provide all the skills we need to achieve our goals
            * healthcare education should start from our homes covering:
            - what to eat 
            - how to eat
        
        - Our agriculture should be organic one, which can feed everyone in this world.
