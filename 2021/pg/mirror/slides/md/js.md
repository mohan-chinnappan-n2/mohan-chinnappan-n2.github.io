## Runtime
![JS Runtime](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*4lHHyfEhVB0LnQ3HlhSs8g.png)
- JavaScript engine parses the source code 
- Turns it into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). 
    - Based on that AST, the interpreter(ignition in V8) can start to do its thing and produce bytecode.
- The bytecode can be sent to the optimizing compiler (TurboFan in V8) along with profiling data
    - Optimizing compiler makes certain assumptions based on the profiling data it has, and then produces highly-optimized machine code.

## V8
- Googleâ€™s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. 
- It is used in:
    - Chrome and in Node.js, among others. 
    - It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, 
    - Runs on :
        - Windows 7 or later, 
        - macOS 10.12+
        -  Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors. 
        - V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application (example: node.js)
