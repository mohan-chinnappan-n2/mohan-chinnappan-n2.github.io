 Design is a way of changing life and influencing the future

 - Sir Ernest Hall

```

```

“The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world 
are the ones who do.”

— Apple’s “Think Different” commercial, 1997
 
```

```
When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds
are not in your favour. 

- Elon Musk

## Key Concepts

![Jobs on Design](img/jobs1.png)
- Design is about how things work not how they look
- Always design with the customer experience and the sense of future in mind
- Making products just functionally adequate is **not good enough**, they should **great!**
- We can achieve what we want when we are **laser focused**

### Laser Focus
```
Steve Jobs advice to Larry Page:

Figure out what Google wants to be when it grows up.
What are the five products you want to focus on? 
Get rid of the rest, because they’re dragging you down.


```

## Process vs Content and Innovation

```
Apple is a very disciplined company, and we have great processes. 
But that's not what it's about. 
Process makes you more efficient.

- Steve Jobs
```

- Process gets you efficiency
- Process is not the content and innovation
- Without the **best content and innovation**, the process can't get you much!
- Hire people with content and innovative mind to make your efforts successful!

 
## Simplicity
- Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication
- Simplify things by zeroing in on their **essence** and eliminating unnecessary components.
- **Sony Walkman vs iPod**


![ipod-walkman](img/ipad-walkman.png)

- It usually takes a lot of **hard work** to make something **simple** to:
	-  truly understand the underlying challenges 
	-  come up with elegant solutions
```
- IPod Design:

At one point Jobs made the simplest of all suggestions: 

Let’s get rid of the on/off button. At first the team members were taken aback, 
but then they realized the button was unnecessary. 
The device would gradually power down if it wasn’t being used and
would spring to life when reengaged.

- Tony Fadell, iPod team lead


```

- Design with simplicity in the integration as well

```

People are busy.
They have other things to do than 
think about how to integrate their computers and devices.

- Steve Jobs
```

- Everyone will agree that:
	- Television needs this kind of simplicity:
		- Have you able to watch the content you like to watch with few clicks on a simple device?

 

## Do not build products with does not match:

- Culture/Image of the company
- Distribution channel of the company
- Current and future customers

- Integrate customer experience into the design and development to build:

	- **Beautiful, elegant and simple-to-use products** providing superior functionalities

- **Make product to evolve**
	- This provides motivation for *continued innovation*
		- Like Salesforce delivering 3 times in a year:
			- With hundreds of **innovative features** to the customers with 3 times a year during  seasonal releases: **Spring, Summer, and Winter**

- User Centered approach to problem solving

![Design Thinking](img/Design-Thinking.png)

## Empathize 
- Foundation of human centered 
- Uncover needs that customer have which they may or may not be aware of
- Guide innovation efforts
- Identify right user  to design for
- Discover the emotions that guide behaviors

## Define
- Scope a specific and meaningful challenge
- Explicitly explains the problem we are solve 

## Ideate
- Generate radical design alternatives
- Going wide in terms of concepts and outcomes
- Step beyond obvious solutions
- Harness collective perspectives
- Get obvious solutions out of your heads

## Prototype
- Getting ideas and explorations out of your head into  the physical world
- Learn
- Solve disagreements
- Fail quickly and cheaply

## Testing
- Getting feedback on the solutions
- Refine solutions to make them better
- Continue to know about the customers

<google-codelab-step label='  Human Centered Design (HCD)'>
<div id='s3-md' class='md' data-trim='false'>
  - Puts the customers first, resulting in useful and usable products and services
- Keeps customers at the heart of the product development process
- End with tailor-made solutions that satisfy customers needs
- Involves co-designing and collaboration
	- Build empathy with your customers so that you’re more confident in your solutions.
	- Engage with users to uncover as many problems as possible, then narrow your focus on one of these problems.
- Failure is a learning experience

## Phases
- Define
	- immerse yourself in your users’ lives to gain a better understanding of who they are.
	- Observe and ask questions to see things from their point of view. 
	- Identify your biases and assumptions so you can deviate from them if they don’t align with your users’ reality

- Ideate
	- 
- Prototype and test
- Implement




- User Desirability, Technology Capabilities, Market Viability
- Product will be the  Heart and soul of the Design Team
- Start with Design
	- From the customer needs (NO compromise there)
	- Not by technology limitations 
- Smallest Details are considered
	- not just for the look
	- functions, features and packaging
- Design team go DEEP
	- find the key underlying principle of the problem we are solving
- This simplicity is the ultimate sophistication

  - Human centered approach - connect with people we are trying to serve
	- Make persona for the customers interviewed
- Understand customers to create meaningful value
- Observe, empathize and get into their world and see the world in their eyes

## Design
- Clean 
- Clarity
## Validation
- Testing Design
- Delight our users

- Take a busy screen
	- lack organization
	- customer don't read most of the UI
		- Trim it down
		- Add headings
		- Use lists
		- Prioritize with colors/fonts
- Speak human

- Details are not the details
	- they make the design
- Design is  about solving BIG problems 
- Functional to Enjoyable transformation
	- small thing, does one thing very well 
		- Give Rating, Login...

  ![Microinterations](img/Microinteractions.png)

- Bring Data forward
	- progressive disclosure
		- do not throw every piece of data at the user
		- allow them to discover it over time
			- Example a badge on the icon to show how many message you have now!
			- showing what is important data
		- what info is available
			- in what increments
			- when we can present them?
				- all these info is important at different times
				- align the information delivery with when the user needs them
			- within what context making it appropriate?
		
![costco near me](img/costco-nearme.png)
- Google provides a value added information
	- address
	- open or closed
	- phone number to call
	
- Don't start from 0
	- Devices in channels captures information about the caller for example, make use of that info as starting point
	- Example location specific info - weather using geo-location
	- What is the system knows
		- Device type / Browser type
		- Time of the day
		- Location
		- User Role
		- Age/Sex
	- Example knowing the browser and provide info for that browser
	- MacOS reducing the fan speed when the user is using dictation

	- User Behavior
		- 
- Remove and absorb complexity
- Speak human
- Prevent human error

## Background
![GC-1](img/gcd-2.png)

- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is an application that I love and use almost every day
- Every time in the GCP UI, I feel it can be better and Human Centered Design (HCD) can used to improve this great application.
- Looks it is a one giant Angular application written by various sub-teams 
- Sub-systems are not **integrated** in a seamless way!
	- Makes to remember Steve's idea of **removing on-off button** in iPods
	- Usual outcome if the sub-teams are *not properly coordinated*
- To fix this GCP team has to write large volume of help guides and documentation 
	- This is hard to maintain and sustain
- Sometimes, I feel GCP does follow the follow this rule:
	-  **Do not start from data 0**

### How is AWS console doing in this area?
- I love this application also

- AWS console uses progressive disclosure in the main page
![aws-1](img/aws-1.png)
- But it falls back to kitchen-sink or "showing org-chart" 
![aws-2](img/aws-2.png)

### How is Apple Store connect doing in this area?
- Another great application
- It is not perfect yet, but made not of progress in Human Centered Design Area
![Apple Store connect](img/apple-store-connect-1.png)
