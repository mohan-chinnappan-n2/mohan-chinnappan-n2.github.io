“The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world 
are the ones who do.”

— Apple’s “Think Different” commercial, 1997
 
```

```
When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds
are not in your favour. 

- Elon Musk

## Key Concepts

![Jobs on Design](img/jobs1.png)
- Design is about how things work not how they look
- Always design with the customer experience and the sense of future in mind
- Making products just functionally adequate is **not good enough**, they should **great!**
- We can achieve what we want when we are **laser focused**

### Laser Focus
```
Steve Jobs advice to Larry Page:

Figure out what Google wants to be when it grows up.
What are the five products you want to focus on? 
Get rid of the rest, because they’re dragging you down.


```

## Process vs Content and Innovation

```
Apple is a very disciplined company, and we have great processes. 
But that's not what it's about. 
Process makes you more efficient.

- Steve Jobs
```

- Process gets you efficiency
- Process is not the content and innovation
- Without the **best content and innovation**, the process can't get you much!
- Hire people with content and innovative mind to make your efforts successful!

 
## Simplicity
- Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication
- Simplify things by zeroing in on their **essence** and eliminating unnecessary components.
- **Sony Walkman vs iPod**


![ipod-walkman](img/ipad-walkman.png)

- It usually takes a lot of **hard work** to make something **simple** to:
	-  truly understand the underlying challenges 
	-  come up with elegant solutions
```
- IPod Design:

At one point Jobs made the simplest of all suggestions: 

Let’s get rid of the on/off button. At first the team members were taken aback, 
but then they realized the button was unnecessary. 
The device would gradually power down if it wasn’t being used and
would spring to life when reengaged.

- Tony Fadell, iPod team lead


```

- Design with simplicity in the integration as well

```

People are busy.
They have other things to do than 
think about how to integrate their computers and devices.

- Steve Jobs
```

- Everyone will agree that:
	- Television needs this kind of simplicity:
		- Have you able to watch the content you like to watch with few clicks on a simple device?

 

## Do not build products with does not match:

- Culture/Image of the company
- Distribution channel of the company
- Current and future customers

- Integrate customer experience into the design and development to build:

	- **Beautiful, elegant and simple-to-use products** providing superior functionalities

- **Make product to evolve**
	- This provides motivation for *continued innovation*
		- Like Salesforce delivering 3 times in a year:
			- With hundreds of **innovative features** to the customers with 3 times a year during  seasonal releases: **Spring, Summer, and Winter**

- Bring Data forward
	- progressive discolsure
		- do not throw every piece of data at the user
		- allow them to disover it over time

			- in what increments
			- when we can present them?
				- all these info is important at differenct times
