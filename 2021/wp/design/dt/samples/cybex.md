            - Bill's Manager's feedback was not great! Bill believed in it
                - went on and made better and rough prototype to validate his ideas
                - put that prototype in use with the users (TEST)
                - took this to a hotel gym and measured how many users preferred his prototype (VALIDATION) 
                - used this data to put this modified product into market
                - got 20% growth in 2 years in a row!
                - Bill solved fear problem - real human need - better product
