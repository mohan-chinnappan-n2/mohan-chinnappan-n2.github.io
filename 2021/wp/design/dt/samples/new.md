# Design thinking
- Advance on conventional problem solving

## Conventional Problem Solving
- Manager says **Implement this solution**
- Hand you a grain of sand
- Idea on a PostIt
- Do this!

## Design thinking way
- Hang on
- Before we converge on this one solution
    - Let us diverge and generated as many ideas as possible to solve the problem
    - **DIVERGE before we CONVERGE**
- There are 2 pieces in any **problem solving** endeavor - *instead of just thinking about the solution to the problem*
    - Problem finding 
        - Generate possible potential problems

### Make sure problem and solution overlap well

- makes efforts to assess the fit - problem and solution
