# CLL - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia

- Type of cancer that starts in **cells that become certain white blood cells (called lymphocytes) in the bone marrow**. 
- The cancer (leukemia) cells start in the bone marrow but then go into the blood.
- In CLL, the leukemia cells often build up slowly. 
	- Many people don't have any symptoms for at least a few years. 
	- But over time, the cells grow and spread to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen.

# Leukemia
- Cancer that starts in the blood-forming cells of the bone marrow. 
- When one of these cells changes and becomes a leukemia cell, it no longer matures the way it should and grows out of control.  
-  Often, it divides to make new cells faster than normal. Leukemia cells also don't die when they should. 
	- This allows them to build up in the bone marrow, crowding out normal cells. 
- At some point, leukemia cells leave the bone marrow and **spill into the bloodstream**. 
	- This increases the number of white blood cells (WBC) in the blood.
	-  Once in the blood, leukemia cells can spread to other organs, where they can prevent other cells in the body from functioning normally.
- Leukemia is different from **other types of cancer that start in organs** like the lungs, colon, or breast and then spread to the bone marrow. Cancers that start elsewhere and then spread to the bone marrow are not leukemia.

# Chronic leukemia

- The cells can mature partly (and more are like normal white blood cells), but not completely.
- These cells may look fairly normal, but they're not. They generally don't fight infection as well as normal white blood cells do.
- The leukemia cells survive **longer than normal cells**, and build up, crowding out normal cells in the bone marrow. 
-  It can take a long time before chronic leukemias cause problems, and most people **can live with them for many years**. 
	- But chronic leukemias tend to be harder to cure than acute leukemias.

## Different types of CLL

- One kind of CLL grows very slowly. So it may take a long time before the patient needs treatment.
- The other kind of CLL grows faster and is a more serious disease.
- The leukemia cells from these 2 types look alike, but **lab tests** can tell the difference between them
	-  The tests look for proteins called **ZAP-70** and **CD38**.
	- If the CLL cells have **low amounts of these proteins**, the leukemia tends to grow more slowly and have better long-term outcomes.	


# Bone marrow

- Blood cells are made in the bone marrow.
	-  soft inner part of some bones, like the skull, shoulder blades, ribs, pelvis, and backbones
- made up of:
	- A small number of blood stem cells
	- More mature blood-forming cells
	- 
# Types of blood cells
- Red blood cells
	- carry oxygen from the lungs to all other tissues in the body, and take carbon dioxide back to the lungs to be removed.
	- Having too few red blood cells (anemia) can make you feel tired, weak, and short of breath because:
		-  your body tissues aren't getting enough oxygen.
- Platelets 
	- are actually cell pieces made by a type of bone marrow cell called the **megakaryocyte**. 
	- Platelets are important in **plugging up holes in blood vessels caused by cuts or bruises**. 
		- Having too few platelets (thrombocytopenia) may cause you to bleed or bruise easily.
- White blood cells 
	- help the body fight infections. 
	- Having too few white blood cells (neutropenia) lowers your immune system and can make you more likely to get an infection.

# Types of white blood cells
## Lymphocytes
	- mature, infection-fighting cells that develop from lymphoblasts, a type of blood stem cell in the bone marrow

- The 2 main types of lymphocytes are:
	- B lymphocytes (B cells) 
		- protect the body from invading germs by developing (maturing) into plasma cells, which make proteins called antibodies. 
		- B lymphocytes are the cells that most often develop into **chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)** cells.
	- T lymphocytes (T cells) 
		- can recognize cells infected by viruses and directly destroy these cells. They also help regulate the immune system.

## Granulocytes
- mature, infection-fighting cells that develop from myeloblasts, a type of blood forming cell in the bone marrow.
- The 3 types of granulocytes:
	-  neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils

## Monocytes
- develop from blood-forming monoblasts in the bone marrow and are related to granulocytes. 
- acrophages also help lymphocytes recognize germs and start making antibodies to fight them.

## Typical Treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
### Commonly used drug treatments 
- Targeted therapies are drugs that specifically **target the changes inside cells that cause them to become cancer**.
- targets one or more specific proteins on or in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. 
- targeted drug is often part of the first line of treatment
- Kinase inhibitors
	- These drugs block kinases, which are proteins in cells that normally relay signals (such as telling the **cell to grow**). 
	-  Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK)
		- BTK is a protein that normally helps some CLL cells to grow and survive. 
	-   PI3K
	
## BTK inhibitors
### Ibrutinib (Imbruvica)
- Blocks the activity of BTK in CLL cells
- This drug is taken as a pill
- [ Imbruvica: Oral tablet (420mg) at CVS](https://www.cvs.com/drug/imbruvica/oral-tablet/420mg)
	- IBRUTINIB (eye BROO ti nib) is a medicine that targets proteins in cancer cells and stops the cancer cells from growing. It is used to treat mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, and chronic graft-versus-host diseas

- [Ibrutinib 140 mg in India](https://www.indiamart.com/proddetail/ibrutinib-140-mg-22404649855.html)


### Acalabrutinib (Calquence)
- Blocks the activity of BTK
- This drug is taken by mouth as capsules, typically twice a day.


## PI3K 
- PI3K is a protein that sends signals in cells and controls cell growth.
### Idelalisib (Zydelig)
- Idelalisib blocks a kinase protein called PI3K-delta.
-  It's been shown to help treat CLL after other treatments have been tried. 
- It's a pill taken twice a day.

### Duvelisib (Copiktra)
- blocks two kinase proteins called PI3K-delta and PI3K-gamma
- It's a pill taken twice a day.

## Venetoclax (Venclexta)
- Venetoclax targets BCL-2, a protein in CLL cells that helps them survive longer than they should. 
- This drug can be used alone or along with a monoclonal antibody, such as rituximab. 
- It's taken as a pill once a day.


# Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA)
-  When you have anemia, your bone marrow **doesn't make enough red blood cells**. Or these cells don't work as well as they should.
- Red blood cells carry oxygen to your body. When you have too few red blood cells, your body can't get enough oxygen, leaving you feeling tired or short of breath.

- Red blood cells are made in the spongy material called bone marrow deep inside your bones. These blood cells normally live for about 120 days.


- If you have autoimmune hemolytic anemia, your body’s immune system attacks and destroys red blood cells faster than your bone marrow can make new ones. Sometimes these red blood cells live for only a few days.

## Treatment for AIHA
- Doctors usually first prescribe steroids, such as hydrocortisone or prednisone, to stop your immune system from attacking your red blood cells. A medicine called rituximab may make steroids work even better.
- Other medicines such as azathioprine (Imuran) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) can be used to suppress the immune system.


# Gene therapy
- Gene therapy  transformes some of blood cells into cancer killers
- CAR-T cell therapy, can attack cancer immediately, then stay inside the body for years and evolve there to keep the disease at bay.Such so-called “living drugs” are now used by thousands around the world to treat certain blood cancers.

```
Based on the 10-year results, “we can now conclude that CAR-T cells can actually cure patients of leukemia,” said Dr. Carl June, one of the authors of the study.
```
