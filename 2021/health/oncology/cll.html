- Type of cancer that starts in **cells that become certain white blood cells (called lymphocytes) in the bone marrow**. 
- The cancer (leukemia) cells start in the bone marrow but then go into the blood.
- In CLL, the leukemia cells often build up slowly. 
	- Many people don't have any symptoms for at least a few years. 
	- But over time, the cells grow and spread to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen.

<div id='s1-md' class='md' data-trim='false'>
  - Cancer that starts in the blood-forming cells of the bone marrow. 
- When one of these cells changes and becomes a leukemia cell, it no longer matures the way it should and grows out of control.  
-  Often, it divides to make new cells faster than normal. Leukemia cells also don't die when they should. 
	- This allows them to build up in the bone marrow, crowding out normal cells. 
- At some point, leukemia cells leave the bone marrow and **spill into the bloodstream**. 
	- This increases the number of white blood cells (WBC) in the blood.
	-  Once in the blood, leukemia cells can spread to other organs, where they can prevent other cells in the body from functioning normally.
- Leukemia is different from **other types of cancer that start in organs** like the lungs, colon, or breast and then spread to the bone marrow. Cancers that start elsewhere and then spread to the bone marrow are not leukemia.

- The cells can mature partly (and more are like normal white blood cells), but not completely.
- These cells may look fairly normal, but they're not. They generally don't fight infection as well as normal white blood cells do.
- The leukemia cells survive **longer than normal cells**, and build up, crowding out normal cells in the bone marrow. 
-  It can take a long time before chronic leukemias cause problems, and most people **can live with them for many years**. 
	- But chronic leukemias tend to be harder to cure than acute leukemias.

## Different types of CLL

- One kind of CLL grows very slowly. So it may take a long time before the patient needs treatment.
- The other kind of CLL grows faster and is a more serious disease.
- The leukemia cells from these 2 types look alike, but **lab tests** can tell the difference between them
	-  The tests look for proteins called **ZAP-70** and **CD38**.
	- If the CLL cells have **low amounts of these proteins**, the leukemia tends to grow more slowly and have better long-term outcomes.

- Blood cells are made in the bone marrow.
	-  soft inner part of some bones, like the skull, shoulder blades, ribs, pelvis, and backbones
- made up of:
	- A small number of blood stem cells
	- More mature blood-forming cells

  - Red blood cells
	- carry oxygen from the lungs to all other tissues in the body, and take carbon dioxide back to the lungs to be removed.
	- Having too few red blood cells (anemia) can make you feel tired, weak, and short of breath because:
		-  your body tissues aren't getting enough oxygen.
- Platelets 
	- are actually cell pieces made by a type of bone marrow cell called the **megakaryocyte**. 
	- Platelets are important in **plugging up holes in blood vessels caused by cuts or bruises**. 
		- Having too few platelets (thrombocytopenia) may cause you to bleed or bruise easily.
- White blood cells 
	- help the body fight infections. 
	- Having too few white blood cells (neutropenia) lowers your immune system and can make you more likely to get an infection.

  ## Lymphocytes
	- mature, infection-fighting cells that develop from lymphoblasts, a type of blood stem cell in the bone marrow

- The 2 main types of lymphocytes are:
	- B lymphocytes (B cells) 
		- protect the body from invading germs by developing (maturing) into plasma cells, which make proteins called antibodies. 
		- B lymphocytes are the cells that most often develop into **chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)** cells.
	- T lymphocytes (T cells) 
		- can recognize cells infected by viruses and directly destroy these cells. They also help regulate the immune system.

## Granulocytes
- mature, infection-fighting cells that develop from myeloblasts, a type of blood forming cell in the bone marrow.
- The 3 types of granulocytes:
	-  neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils

## Monocytes
- develop from blood-forming monoblasts in the bone marrow and are related to granulocytes. 
- acrophages also help lymphocytes recognize germs and start making antibodies to fight them.

## Typical Treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
### Commonly used drug treatments 
- brutinib (Imbruvica), alone or with rituximab (Rituxan)
- Acalabrutinib (Calquence), alone or with obinutuzumab (Gazyva)
- Venetoclax (Venclexta) and obinutuzumab 
- Venetoclax alone, or with rituximab
- Bendamustine and rituximab (or another monoclonal antibody)
- High-dose prednisone and rituximab
- FCR: fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab
- PCR: pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab
- Chlorambucil and rituximab (or another monoclonal antibody)
- Obinutuzumab
- Ibrutinib and obinutuzumab
- Alemtuzumab (Campath), alone or with rituximab
