# In-App Guidance (IAG)
-  Add **prompts and walkthroughs** to your app to 
	- share information 
	- train, or onboard users 
- You can add multiple items to the same page, but they don’t appear at the same time
- ![multiple](img/iag-multiple-in-page.png)
- A  user sees only one item per 24 hours, per app by default
- Salesforce shows it **again** or **cancels scheduled recurrences** based on
	-  whether the user interacts with or ignores the prompt or walkthrough
