# TensorFlow Serving

TensorFlow Serving is a flexible, **high-performance serving system** for machine learning models, designed for **production environments**. 

TensorFlow Serving makes it easy to **deploy new algorithms and experiments**, while keeping the same server architecture and APIs. 

[TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/serving/architecture) provides out-of-the-box integration with TensorFlow models, but can be easily extended to serve **other types of models and data**.
