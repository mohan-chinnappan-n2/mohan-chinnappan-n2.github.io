# GPU

The GPU is a processor that is made up of many smaller and more **specialized cores**. By working together, these cores deliver **massive performance** when a processing task can be **divided up** and processed across these cores.

GPUs began as specialized [ASICs - Application Specific Integrated Circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit) developed to **accelerate specific 3D rendering tasks**. 

Over time, these fixed-function engines became more programmable and more flexible. While graphics and the increasingly lifelike visuals of todayâ€™s top games remain their principal function, GPUs have evolved to **become more general-purpose parallel processors as well**, handling a growing range of applications.

Initially GPUs were solving computer **graphics** related problems in Gaming
The General Purpose GPU (GPGPU) plays a vital role in the deep learning and parallel computing.

### What is CUDA?
Compute Unified Device Architecture ([CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-refresher-getting-started-with-cuda/)) is is a parallel computing platform developed by NVIDIA. It enables software programs to perform calculations using both the CPU and GPU.


## What about CPU?

CPU is constructed from millions of transistors.
It can have **multiple processing cores** and is commonly referred to as the brain of the computer. 
It is essential to all modern computing systems as it executes the commands and processes needed for your computer and operating system. 
The CPU is also important in determining how fast programs can run, from surfing the web to building spreadsheets.

The CPU is suited to a wide variety of workloads, especially those for which latency or per-core performance are important. A powerful execution engine, the CPU focuses its **smaller number of cores on individual tasks and on getting things done quickly. This makes it uniquely well equipped for jobs ranging from serial computing to running databases.
