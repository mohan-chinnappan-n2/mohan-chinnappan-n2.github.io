# Chapter 1 : Quick Introduction

- In traditional programming we start with **data** and **rules** to apply on the data to get **answers**. This style of programming can't bring answers for problems predicting a type of cat in the cat picture.

As shown in the demo below, user provides a image of the cat, the application predicts type of the cat in that image with a confidence (probability) with help of Machine Learning.

To build this kind of solution using traditional programming, we may have to write too many rules or sometimes this problem is not easily solvable by our traditional programming. Here comes our hero Machine Learning to our rescue us!
