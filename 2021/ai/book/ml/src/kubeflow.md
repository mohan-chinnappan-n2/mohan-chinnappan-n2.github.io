Kubeflow is an open source ML platform dedicated to making deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable. 

Kubeflow Pipelines is part of the **Kubeflow platform** that enables composition and execution of reproducible workflows on Kubeflow, integrated with experimentation and notebook based experiences. 

Kubeflow Pipelines services on Kubernetes include the hosted Metadata store, container based orchestration engine, notebook server, and UI to help users develop, run, and manage complex ML pipelines at scale. 

The Kubeflow Pipelines SDK allows for creation and sharing of components and composition and of pipelines programmatically.
